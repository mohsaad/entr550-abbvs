          <br />At first, I did not like this book. The first third of this book is extremely boring and throws you into a desert world without any context for the characters, which I found very jarring and hard to understand. But as you read through the second and third parts, you start to appreciate how the first part of the book was written as Paul grows up and takes on his enemies. It's a very fun, exciting adventure through the universe and I'm looking forward to the movie.

          <span class="author">by Howard Zinn</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />A different perspective on American History, written from the people that "lost", including the Native Americans, the slaves, and the working classes. It's written with an idea in mind, that America was a society that built on and exploited these people, and that the idea of "class mobility" is a little bit of a fib. The book also takes an aggressive shot at the idea of American Exceptionalism, arguing that the best of times for people were really under socialists and their societies. In a sense, it reads more like a full-throated argument for socialism rather than anything else, which is an interesting concept. As a contrarian, I really liked this book, but I did find the zealousness a bit annoying. It's a very worthwhile read.

          <span class="author">by Imam Abu Jafar At-Tahawi</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />If you're a Muslim, read this book, and really try to reflect on the concepts and how they affect your perception of God in your daily life. This is essentially a book on "what do we believe", and should be basic concepts about God, his attributes and powers. It's also a small primer on some of the day-to-day, but not a huge detail of laws and actions. It's short and so I recommend it.

          <span class="author">by Jonathan Frazen</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />People call this a "Great American Novel" and I'm inclided to both agree and disagree. It's... a strange book. It tells the story of this perfect, ideal family and how said perfect, ideal family falls apart, mostly because the mother has a ton of issues in her own personal life that end up spilling into everyone else's. It's an interesting take on a woman whose own independent personality really has an effect on her closest relatives, including her husband, son, and daughter, and how those people change with time, take on new personalities and beliefs. Compared to her husband, Walter, who is ideological to a fault, the main character is emotional, neurotic, and probably depressed. She has her own set of family issues which causes her to resent where she came from, and a lot of the novel is seen from her perspective as she comes to terms with her background. The same goes for the other characters, who, given the effects of the main character, tries to navigate a new world of the early 2000s, with Iraq and the internet revolution coming along. I think it's an interesting example of life with its ups and downs, and as a result I'd really recommend it.

          <span class="author">by Matt Ruff</span>
          <br />A book based on virtual reality tech that doesn't exist yet, with a plot that feels somewhat relevant. This is a strange book - it's a deep dive into MMORPGs and a futuristic virtual world, and all the weirdness of internet culture that comes out of it. Interweaved into it is an actual plot about identity and how easy it is to misrepresent on the internet. We all live as avatars in the real world, and sometimes its easy to hide that aspect of ourselves. The plot sags in the middle (too much intimate details that are really not needed) but the ending is interestng enough for a read.

          <span class="author">by Yann Martel</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />What a read! Life of Pi is super interesting because it's a book that's both great on the superficial level, but also has plenty of details you can dive into and reflect on. I think the main part of the book that I really enjoyed was his phases of life - he's on the raft, but the raft molds him into something he's not - a tiger to survive. And when he's off, the tiger persona leaves him as well, as it's not needed. Add into it is Pi's search for religion, and what it really represents in our lives and the world around us, and it's a book to think about for a long time.

          <span class="author">by Michael Lewis</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />Moneyball is the story of how we value things. Michael Lewis is mostly known for books about Wall Street and its history, but instead here he writes about the story of the 2002 Oakland Atheltics - one of the poorest teams in baseball, with a payroll of ~30 million dollars. Baseball is a sport that very much relies on money, as there is no salary cap, forcing poorer teams to find ways to field and compete without spending too much. The Oakland A's were a powerhouse that year, winning more games than any other team in the league, by finding players using sabermetrics. For a long time, these players were overlooked for one reason or another, but Oakland and Billy Beane put together a team that managed to harness their abilities in a way that created a winning team. The movie is also one of my favorites, and well worth a watch.

          <span class="author">by Russ</span>
          <br />A very motivational book that once again, tells you to ignore everything, push what you think is right, and do whatever it takes. I think these are fine concepts, but they've been done so many times that I don't really think this stands out. I think the one comment that does stick with me is "It's all in your head." No one else is thinking about the things you think about, so why care about them?

          <span class="author">by Leo Tolstoy</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />I'm not sure if you can even call this a book, as it's only something like 30 pages of exposition. But I found it very impactful. I think what spoke to me most was this idea that nothing matters when you die. As muslims, we know this - it's instilled in us from a young age to not regard these things as permanent, and that God can take them away at any point. But I think seeing Ivan Ilyich's life grow and him relegate himself to these material successes that didn't mean anything speaks to me. It's the idea of drowning yourself in fake promotions and fake success because the real world is terrifying and scary, and finding a place in the working world, while easier in the short term, but comes at a cost to your moral and personal life.

          <span class="author">by Cal Newport</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />Deep Work is about how to execute and do focused, hard work. The idea here is that you can accomplish more in a few hours of deep, undistracted focused work than a lots of hours of what he calls "shallow" work, which is things like checking email, responding to messages, or doing very surface level things. I really appreciated the books approach in how to strucutre your time, whether that's with the Palmodoro method (25min on, 5min off) or by literally scheduling every single part of your day. It's not really interesting to read about, though, and it's fairly short - I put it down for two months and didn't pick it back up, even if it was ultimatly something I wanted to do.

          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Path-Power-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/0679729453" alt="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Path to Power</a>
          <span class="author">by Robert A. Caro</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />I've been really curious recently about why Lyndon Johnson, a person from the South, came to become the formidable Democrat he was during the 1960s. Caro's work is definitive, and you can tell why. Every chapter is told in excruciating detail, how Johnson weaved a path to power through his youth and college years, to brown-nosing important men when he wanted to get ahead, by forging alliances when it was not needed, and being ultimately pragmatic in his approach to power. It almost reads as a political guide to how to attain power, and especially with money in today's politics, his approaches seem so familiar. 100% worth a read if you're interested in how people attain and wield power, even in today's modern times.

          <span class="author">by William Dietz</span>
          <br />This book is essentially a retelling of the first game in the series, and in my opinion doesn't really add anything new. While it is interesting to see what happened with the rest of the crew on the Pillar of Autumn, the book essentially tries to re-tell the game in a different manner that isn't as enjoyable as just playing the game. There's also no real extra information about the world or why the people are doing what they're doing, although the Covenant bits are probably the closest we can get to that. All in all, I wouldn't recommend to read unless you're a really big fan of the Halo Universe.

          <span class="author">by Various Authors</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />I actually really like this collection of short stories in the Halo Universe. There's a lot of interesting stories that reveal attitudes after the Human-Covenant War, especially among the colonists who are trying to resettle after it all went down. Kind of interesting to see how the Sangelli and humans get along (which is, to say, not well). Plus it has the epilogue of Bornstellar Meets Eternal Lasting, which is a nice closure to his story.

          <span class="author">by Eric Nylund</span>
          <br />People say that Halo is easy science fiction, and at first I wanted to disagree with them. But after re-reading this book, I can see it. It's very focused on the military tactics of the time beween the first two games, and not enough on world building. There's a lot of unexplained things that go missed, like what exactly the Forerunner crystal does / is important. The entire Unyielding Heirophant section should have been longer and more detailed, rather than a few chapters. I think the book constantly leaves you hanging on the edge of the seat, which is fun the first time you read it, but not really any other times.

          <span class="author">by Robert A. Caro</span> <span class="star">★</span>
          <br />This work chronicles the years of Lyndon Johnson in between losing his first Senate race in 1941 and winning in 1948. Set against the backdrop of WWII, it's an interesting example of how politicians who can successfully cultivate influence among the government and also pay off local politicians can attain great power and wealth. Caro doesn't like Johnson, but there's almost a begurdging respect for his schemes. He also seems to idolize Coke Stevenson, the former governer, quite a bit. Overall, though, a fantastic book about how to cultivate influence and really become political.
